  <h1>First Day of My Nanodegree!</h1>
  <p>I am very excited to start my work here with Udacity. 
  I work full time for at&t. I just completed my bachelors and 
  ready to complete multiple nanodegrees for my career transistion
  into IT.</p>
  <h1>The Basics</h1>
  <p>I have made multiple html pages using dreamweaver. Even though
    this a very simple course for me so far, I hope to have my brain
    tested with python language later.</p>
  <h1>Vacation</h1>
  <p>It is almost summer time. That means it is time to pick a tropical
    destination to visit for a vacation! Definitely a needed trip here
    soon! </p>
